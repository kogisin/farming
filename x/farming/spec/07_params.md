| NextEpochDays              | uint32    | 1                                                                   |
| FarmingFeeCollector        | string    | "cosmos1h292smhhttwy0rl3qr4p6xsvpvxc4v05s6rxtczwq3cs6qc462mqejwy8x" |
| DelayedStakingGasFee       | sdk.Gas   | 60000                                                               |

## PrivatePlanCreationFee

Fee paid for to create a Private type Farming plan. This fee prevents spamming and is collected in in the community pool of the distribution module.

## NextEpochDays

`NextEpochDays` is the epoch length in number of days. Internally, the farming module uses `CurrentEpochDays` parameter to process staking and reward distribution in end blocker because using `NextEpochDays` directly will affect farming rewards allocation.

## FarmingFeeCollector

A farming fee collector is a module account address that collects farming fees, such as staking creation fee and private plan creation fee.

## DelayedStakingGasFee

Since the farming module has adopted delayed staking,
handling `MsgStake` does not immediately consumes gas.
Instead, gas for this newly queued staking is consumed at the end of the epoch.
`DelayedStakingGasFee` is to impose gas fee for this reason.
