 # State Transitions

This document describes the state transaction operations pertaining to the farming module.

## Plan

As stated in [01_concepts.md](01_concepts.md), there are public and private farming plans available in the `farming` module. Private plan can be created by any account whereas public plan can only be created through governance proposal.

```go
// PlanType enumerates the valid types of a plan.
type PlanType int32

const (
    // PLAN_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED defines the default plan type.
    PlanTypeNil PlanType = 0
    // PLAN_TYPE_PUBLIC defines the public plan type.
    PlanTypePublic PlanType = 1
    // PLAN_TYPE_PRIVATE defines the private plan type.
    PlanTypePrivate PlanType = 2
)
```

- Staking Coins for Farming
  - Each `Plan` defines a list of `StakingCoinWeights` using `sdk.DecCoins`
  - Each weight in `StakingCoinWeights` is calculated in accordance with the total rewards and farmers who stake the coin denom defined in `StakingCoinWeights` will receive the relative amount of rewards.

- Multiple Farming Coins within a `farmingPoolAddress`
  - If `farmingPoolAddress` has multiple kinds of coins, then all coins are identically distributed following the given `farmingPlan`

- Time Parameters
  - Each `farmingPlan` has its own `startTime` and `endTime`

- Distribution Method
  - `FixedAmountPlan`
    - fixed amount of coins are distributed per `CurrentEpochDays`
    - `epochAmount` is `sdk.Coins`
  - `RatioPlan`
    - ratio of total assets in `farmingPoolAddress` is distributed per `CurrentEpochDays`
    - `epochRatio` is in percentage

- Termination Address
  - When the plan ends after the `endTime`, transfer the balance of `farmingPoolAddress` to `terminationAddress`.

## Stake

When a farmer stakes an amount of coins, the following state transitions occur:

- it reserves the amount of coins to the staking reserve pool account `StakingReservePoolAcc` 
- it creates `QueuedStaking` object and stores the staking coins in `QueueStaking`, which are waiting in a queue until the end of epoch to move to `Staking` object
- it imposes more gas if the farmer already has `Staking` with the same coin denom(see [07_params.md](07_params.md#DelayedStakingGasFee) for details)

## Unstake

When a farmer unstakes an amount of coins, the following state transitions occur:

- it adds `Staking` and `QueueStaking` amounts to see if the unstaking amount is sufficient
- it automatically withdraws rewards for the coin denom which are accumulated over the last epochs
- it subtracts the unstaking amount of coins from `QueueStaking` first and if it is not sufficient then it subtracts from `Staking`
- it releases the unstaking amount of coins to the farmer

## Harvest (Reward Withdrawal)

- it calculates `CumulativeUnitRewards` in `HistoricalRewards` object in order to get the rewards for the staking coin denom which are accumulated over the last epochs for the farmer
- it releases the accumulated rewards to the farmer if it is not zero and decreases the `OutstandingRewards`
- it sets `StartingEpoch` in `Staking` object

## Reward Allocation

Each abci end block call, the operations to update rewards allocation are to execute:

- it calculates rewards allocation information for the end of the current epoch depending on plan type `FixedAmountPlan` or `RatioPlan`
- it distributes total allocated coins from each planâ€™s farming pool address `FarmingPoolAddress` to the rewards reserve pool account `RewardsReserveAcc`
- it calculates staking coin weight for each denom in each plan and gets the unit rewards by denom
- it updates `HistoricalRewards` and `CurrentEpoch` based on the allocation information
- it automatically withdraws the accumulated rewards to the farmer with the given staking coin denom if `Staking` position exists
- it deletes `QueueStaking` object after moving `QueueCoins` to `StakedCoins` in `Staking` object
- it increases `TotalStakings` for the staking coin denom
